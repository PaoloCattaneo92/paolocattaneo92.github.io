# Document Maker
This library is used to create MarkDown and HTML document files from C# code, a technique very useful when you have some data organized in class objects and you want to create a document report for them.

I think that this approach is very much straightforward from data objects to its "on paper" counterparts, with a fluid and simple syntax. 

Read more about how to use _Document Maker_ library on its official [Github project link](https://github.com/PaoloCattaneo92/DocumentMaker), I have written a lot of examples and specific
guide about how to use every feature.
